# Patient Data Manager - Backend Server

## About

This project is the backend for the Patient Data Manager.

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

 - Ruby, v2.6.3 or higher ([rvm](https://rvm.io/) is recommended for managing multiple versions of Ruby)
 - PostgreSQL, v9.4 or higher, running on port 5432

### Installation
```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

### Running via Docker with a disposable database
```
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=`openssl rand -hex 64`
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

# finally, to confirm it worked -- should see "<#> runs, <#> assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips" at the end
bundle exec rake test
```

### Usage
```sh
bundle exec rails s
```

To optionally specify port: (default is 3000 if not specified)

```sh
bundle exec rails s --port 7001
```

To execute the test suite:

```sh
bundle exec rake test
```

### Configuring the front end

At present, the CORS headers required to run the front end on a different server are commented out. If the front end is running on a different web server, you will need to add back in the `Rack::Cors` middleware in `config/application.rb` before it will work.
